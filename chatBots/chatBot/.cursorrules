## Cursor AI Rules for Web Development

### General Guidelines
- **Follow Kul Elektronik's hierarchy and design structure**: The new website should maintain a consistent look and feel with https://www.kulelektronik.com/.
- **Use SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and Vite**: All code must be written strictly using these technologies.
- **Only Tailwind for styling**: No external CSS or frameworks apart from Tailwind.
- **Maintain SvelteKit's folder structure**: Do not modify or create non-standard folder arrangements.
- **Clear and professional coding style**: Maintain clean, well-documented, and structured code.
- **Avoid unnecessary code**: Keep everything as minimal and optimized as possible.
- **Modern and intelligent look**: Design must be sleek and smart, using Tailwind styles accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure full mobile and desktop compatibility.
- **Follow MVVM principles**: Maintain a clean separation of concerns in code.
- **Do not remove imported libraries**: Keep all necessary imports.
- **Minimalist and 3D-friendly design**: Icons and buttons should be both simple and modern with a 3D aesthetic.
- **Use Kul Elektronik's fonts**: Maintain consistency with their typography.

### UI Features
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Implement a button allowing users to switch between dark and light themes.
- **Navigation and Components**:
  - Header with site navigation.
  - Footer with relevant links and company information.
  - Main content area structured for chatbot UI.
- **Chatbot UI (Phase 1 - UI Only)**:
  - Design should be based on the provided chatbot UI reference.
  - Placeholder areas for chatbot interactions.
  - Functional buttons for microphone and options.
  
### Phase 2 Features (Future Implementation)
- **Chatbot Functionality**: API integration for chatbot responses.
- **Authentication System**: User login and authentication mechanisms.

### File Structure (Before Coding)
- **`src/routes`**: Contains page components structured according to SvelteKit conventions.
- **`src/lib/components`**: Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, dark mode toggle, chatbot UI components).
- **`src/lib/styles`**: Tailwind configuration and any additional style-related utilities.
- **`src/lib/stores`**: State management for dark mode and UI behavior.
- **`static/`**: Contains assets like icons and images.

### Dark/Light Mode Implementation
- **State Management**:
  - Use Svelte stores to manage theme switching.
  - Save user preference in local storage.
- **Toggle Button**:
  - Floating button in the UI for easy access.
  - Smooth transitions between themes.
  - Use Tailwind’s dark mode utilities.

This document ensures the development follows a structured approach aligned with Kul Elektronik’s branding and UX/UI expectations.
